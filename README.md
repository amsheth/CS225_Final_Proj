# C++ Compilation Instructions
Presumes running with cmake, make ready to go; similar to our in-class usage:

Setup: `mkdir c++/build && cd c++/build && cmake .. && make`

Run: `./main`

Or, manually:
1. Make subdirectory of `c++/` for build output (eg. `c++/build`).
2. In that directory, run `cmake ..`
3. Compile using `make` and execute using `./main`
