# Team Contract

## Communication
###### 1. Team Meetings

We will mostly use Discord to discuss work on the project. We will have in person meetings later whenever it would help achieve our goals more productively but simple or routine meetings will be planned virtually to reduce the scheduling impact. We will meet once per week over Discord at first and adjust as needed.

###### 2. Assistance 

The Discord server or direct messasges should be used for questions. Response time should be very quick using those methods and should be less than a day for most questions.

###### 3. Respect

Work by following standard social etiquette such as avoiding talking over others, asking questions when confused, ensuring proper behavior, and so forth. Disrespectful behavior should not occur but if it does, it will be addressed (see Conflict Resolution).

## Collaboration

###### 4. Work Distribution

Everyone should be expected to carry their own weight, but if a member needs help on something they may be unfamiliar with then it is naturally absolutely fine to ask for help. We have a diverse group and some of us may know more about certain topics and others may know more about other topics. There should be satisfactory work distribution as long as each group member attempts to carry their own weight and participates in completion of the final project.

###### 5. Time Commitment

For now, during the planning and early stages at most 3-5 hours per week could be expected of members. Half of us have marching band as a major time commitment right now that will decrease later on. There is also still a lot of work to do for CS225 outside of the final project.

In the later stages of the project there will be much more work to do in order to complete the project. No estimate can be reasonably put on that right now, but we will be able to afford putting in more hours per week later in the semester when everyone has a bit more time.

###### 6. Conflict Resolution

Any concerns about something regarding the project will be handled over Discord messages between group members. If something goes badly wrong or the concern is not resolved after discussion over Discord, then one of us will reach out to course staff and go from there. Everyone should be as respectful as possible in case of a disagreement or misunderstanding.
